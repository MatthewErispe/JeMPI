# Installation

JemPI can be installed in two ways:

* [Standalone Installation](standalone-installation.md): This is useful for development or custom implementations
* [Jembi Platform Installation](jembi-platform-installation.md): This is the recommended way to install JemPI, it uses the Jembi Platform deployment tooling which allows JemPI to be installed with a single command. It also includes other useful software like the OpenHIM to authenticate API and route API request.
